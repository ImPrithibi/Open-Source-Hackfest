OpenMap System
The OpenMap System is an open-source interactive map platform that allows users to make submissions and add points of interest to the map. This repository serves as the main codebase for the OpenMap System. The project will be divided into two teams, each responsible for implementing a specific feature set:

Team 1: Bathroom Locator
Team 1 will focus on developing the Bathroom Locator feature. This feature allows users to submit and access information about public bathroom locations, along with updates on how crowded and clean they are.

Features
Users can add new bathroom locations to the map.
Users can update the status of a bathroom (cleanliness, crowd level).
Users can view information about nearby bathrooms.
Team 2: Food Finder
Team 2 will concentrate on developing the Food Finder feature. This feature enables users to submit and access information about food locations, including updates on pricing and food quality.

Features
Users can add new food locations to the map.
Users can update information about food pricing and quality.
Users can search for nearby food options based on preferences.
